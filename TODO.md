## TODO

Some of the things we might to do in the next versions:

- Hide (light) armor blueprints on Gipath
- Widescreen
- Allow to select (all) stats for the main PC
- Configurable auto-aim (hands by default)
- Open Ruins/Witch's Cave/Death Canyon/Wormheads's Cave for returning
- Better loot from Khadaganians on Gipath
- Disable batteries
- Make run speed/length dependent on current load
